Example for adding a new level in D2R

Just cube a town portal scroll while in Harrogath and a red portal will open to the new area.

## Known Issues
Opening a portal from the Pitzilla Level 2 back to Harrogath, and then re-entering through the red portal will crash the game. If anyone knows a fix to this feel free to create a pull request.
